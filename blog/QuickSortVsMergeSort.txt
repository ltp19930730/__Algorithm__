Quick sort is quite different with Merge sort, I used to think they are the same in time complexity. Both are O(NlogN);

Quick sort :
T: the average Time complexity is O(NlogN) --> the mean
M: the space complexity is O(1) in place method
S: It is not stable (In place sort is not stable)
Partition

More formally, the data being sorted can be represented as a record or tuple of values,
and the part of the data that is used for sorting is called the key. I
n the card example, cards are represented as a record (rank, suit), and the key is the rank.
A sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key,
and R appears before S in the original list, then R will always appear before S in the sorted list.


Merge sort :
T: the best and worst case is both O(NlogN)
M: The space complexity is O(n)
S: Stable
Merge
